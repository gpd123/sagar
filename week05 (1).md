# Task 3. Analyse HTTP Packet Capture

a) 
 when we access to the  link the browser send the HTTP request for 12214839.html page. The server is able to response so the page is visible.
 
 b)For the first HTTP request/response the five address is given below:
 
 Source IP address: 192.168.56.1
 Destination IP address: 192.168.56.2
 Source Port Number: 59297
 Destination Port Number: 80
 Protocol: Transmission Control Protocol

                               Fig.5.3)  HTTP packets with http filter
 
  
 c) Yes while clicking the button it send request to the server in our case because this feature is created with event listner.If this functionality is implemented using scripting language, the user's browser will process the request locally. without requiring interaction with the web server
 
 
 d) The Packet diagram for 12214838.html is given below:

    Fig.5.3.d) Packet Diagram
 
 e)  The value of the referrer in the HTTP request was "http://192.168.56.2/". It identify the URL of the page that the user was on before they clicked on the link to the current page. 
The referrer header is used by web servers for a variety of purposes, including:

1)monitoring how users arrive onto their pages
2) optimising for search engines (SEO)
3) monitoring how visitors use their website
4) monitoring the success of marketing initiatives

 
 f) The server did not learn any information about the web browser from the HTTP request http://192.168.56.2/. This is because the User-Agent header was not present in the request. The User-Agent header is a standard header field in HTTP requests that identifies the web browser and operating system that is being used to make the request. If the User-Agent header is not present, the server will not be able to learn anything about the web browser.
 
 
 
 g) The version of HTTP used is HTTP/2.0. The transport protocol used is TCP.
 
 
 H) All together we captured 32 packets for this web page 192.168.56.2. It take 25s between the start of connection setup and
the data transfer.
 
 
 I)In order to confirm that a packet was received properly, an acknowledgement is often issued in an HTTP request after receiving a packet. The sender of the acknowledgement packet anticipates receiving an acknowledgement packet for its acknowledgement packet since the acknowledgement packet specifies the sequence number of the packet that was received.
